# Invoicelytics
> TBD TODO Add URL here

Invoicelytics is a product that is meant to make it much easier working with invoices. All you need to do is uploading invoices in PDF format into Invoicelytics. Once that's done, you can ask questions about the invoices, such as:
- how much have i spent in the last 30 days?
- how many invoices coming from company ABC have been uploaded?
- how much money is due to company ABC?

# Running the project locally
1. Make sure you have Python installed and Docker installed
2. Open a shell, browse to this repository's root folder and run `docker compose up-d`. This will spin up a local instance of Postgres.
3. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
4. Run `poetry install`
5. Then run `poetry shell` to activate the environment 
6. Now let's initialize the database structure. Run `yoyo apply` and keep hitting `y` until all database migrations are applied to your local database.
7. Notice that the migration scripts already created an initial entry in the `tenants` table for you. Let's also add a user, as you'll need credentials to enter the app. Open the `scripts/insert_user.py` script, adjust it to your emails address and preferred password, and run it with `python3 scripts/insert_user.py`
8. Create a file called `.env` to hold the environment variables. Copy the values provided in `.env.example`. Make sure to create a folder called `/tmp/invoicelytics`.
9. Still on `.env`, you're gonna need to provide an `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can follow [these instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to obtain an API key. 
10. Before running the app, you'll also need to set up an environment variable in the shell: `export FLASK_APP=invoicelytics/run.py`
11. To start the app, run `poetry run python -m flask run`. The app should be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://localhost:5000 .
12. Use the credentials you created earlier and voil√†, you're ready to use the product!
