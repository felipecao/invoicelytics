# Invoicelytics

Invoicelytics is a product that is meant to make it much easier working with invoices. All you need to do is uploading invoices in PDF format into Invoicelytics. Once that's done, you can ask questions about the invoices, such as:
- how much have I spent in the last 30 days?
- how many invoices coming from company ABC have been uploaded?
- how much money is due to company ABC?

# Tech notes

In a nutshell, Invoicelytics is a monolithic app that, behind the scenes, runs an async AI inference pipeline, which is implemented using [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) workflows.

# Running the project locally

1. Make sure you have Python installed and Docker installed
2. Open a shell, browse to this repository's root folder and run `docker compose up-d`. This will spin up a local instance of Postgres.
3. Install and spin up [Temporal](https://learn.temporal.io/getting_started/python/dev_environment/#set-up-a-local-temporal-service-for-development-with-temporal-cli)
4. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)
5. Run `poetry install`
6. Then run `poetry shell` to activate the environment 
7. Now let's initialize the database structure. Run `yoyo apply` and keep hitting `y` until all database migrations are applied to your local database.
8. Notice that the migration scripts already created an initial entry in the `tenants` table for you. Let's also add a user, as you'll need credentials to enter the app. Open the `scripts/insert_user.py` script, adjust it to your emails address and preferred password, and run it with `python3 scripts/insert_user.py`
9. Create a file called `.env` to hold the environment variables. Copy the values provided in `.env.example`. Make sure to create a folder called `/tmp/invoicelytics`.
10. Still on `.env`, you're gonna need to provide an `OPENAI_API_KEY`. You can follow [these instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart) to obtain an API key. 
11. Before running the app, you'll also need to set up an environment variable in the shell: `export FLASK_APP=invoicelytics/run.py`
12. To start the app, run `poetry run python -m flask run`. The app should be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000 or http://localhost:5000 .
13. Use the credentials you created earlier and voilÃ , you're ready to use the product!

# Using the product
> Due to personal budget restrictions, this repo is meant to be ran in local environments only

1. Browse to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
2. Login using the credentials you created earlier.
3. Use the navigation menu and browse to `Invoices` (top right corner of the screen).
4. In this screen, you'll see information about all invoices that have been uploaded into the system, as well as invoices that are pending approval.
5. Click on `Upload an invoice` and select the invoice you'd like to work on (**IMPORTANT**: the system only accepts invoices in **PDF** format).
6. Once you upload the invoice, it's going to be processed in background. In the meanwhile, you can go back to the `Invoices` page while Emma, our Intelligent Assistant, works on it.
7. Once Emma finishes her job, you'll see the new invoice under the `Invoices pending approval` section. You can click on `Review` to check its details.
8. At the invoice detail page, you can review if Emma did a good job and extracted the data correctly from the invoice. You can edit the data and either approve or reject it.
9. Once the invoice is approved, you can browse to `Chat` and ask Emma questions about the approved invoices, such as `How many invoices are there in the system?`, or `How many invoices from vendor X are due this week?` or any other questions about the invoices.
10. If you're curious about the workflow execution on Temporal, you can browse to http://localhost:8233/namespaces/default/workflows as well
